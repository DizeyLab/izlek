//! The SMTP password's second lock.
//!
//! File permissions on the database (see [`TursoStore::open`]) stop a casual
//! `ls` on the server from reading the password, but a copy of the database
//! file — a backup, a snapshot, an `scp` by someone who should not have had
//! it — carries the plaintext right along with it. This module is the fix:
//! the column holds ciphertext, and the key that opens it lives in a second
//! file (`izlek.key`, beside the database) that a database backup does not
//! automatically include.
//!
//! The envelope is `v1:` followed by base64 of a 24-byte XChaCha20-Poly1305
//! nonce and the sealed bytes it protects. The prefix is what lets
//! [`TursoStore::open`] tell a value we sealed apart from a plaintext
//! password left behind by a deployment from before this module existed —
//! see the migration note there. There is deliberately no `v2` yet; add one
//! the day the algorithm changes, and keep `open` accepting both prefixes for
//! as long as ciphertext under the old one might still be sitting in a row.
//!
//! Losing the key file — a backup restored without its sibling, most likely —
//! is not a crash. [`open`] returns `None` on anything it cannot make sense
//! of: wrong key, damaged ciphertext, a value that never was one of ours.
//! The caller in [`TursoStore::smtp_password`] turns that into "no password
//! set", which is the same screen an admin sees on a workspace that never had
//! a sender configured, and the same fix: type the password in again.
